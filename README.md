# CLI-To-Do

A command-line todo application built using Node.js, Knex, and SQLite3.

This tool allows you to manage your tasks via simple CLI commands, supporting task creation, deletion, updates, and marking tasks as completed without removing them from the database. The app stores data using SQLite3 and provides a lightweight, portable todo manager for developers who prefer the command line.

## Stack

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building the CLI.
- **Knex**: SQL query builder for interacting with the SQLite database.
- **SQLite3**: The relational database to store tasks.
- **ESM**: Ecmascript modules for modern JavaScript syntax.

## Features

- Add tasks
- List tasks (all, completed, or incomplete)
- Update tasks
- Delete tasks
- Mark tasks as complete or incomplete

## Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js and NPM installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/CLI-To-Do.git
   cd CLI-To-Do
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Set file permissions for the CLI script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x todo.js
   ```
4. Set up the SQLite3 database:

   - Create the initial database migration:

     ```bash
     npm run knex migrate:make todos
     ```

   - Run the migration to create the `todos` table:
     ```bash
     npm run knex migrate:latest
     ```

5. Seed the database with example data (optional):
   ```bash
   npm run knex seed:make test-tasks
   npm run knex seed:run
   ```

## Usage

The CLI can be run using the following commands:

### List tasks

```bash
./todo.js list
```

#### Outputs:

```bash
1: [ ] Vacuum the house
2: [âœ“] Buy groceries
```

#### List only completed tasks:

```bash
./todo.js list -completed
```

#### List only incomplete tasks:

```bash
./todo.js list -incomplete
```
